# TSP_Nearest_Neighbor_GUI
1. A python script for the TSP problem using Nearest Neighbor algorithm.
2. Can change map image as per your need.
3. Select the cities/places you wanna visit on the map and hit nearest neighbor button at the end to execute the algorithm.
4. Use right click to remove the selected place.
5. The co-ordinate distance will show the graphical distance travelled and the actual distance will be in Kilometers.
6. To calculate the actual distance from the MAP, I just generalised the data by taking one city and measuring its distance from others which helped me in generating one linear formula.
7. For your MAP image you can do same to calculate the actual distance; in my case the error is of 15-20KM.
